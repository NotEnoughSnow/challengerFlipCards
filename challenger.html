         She's efficient, stubborn and impulsive. This isn't surprising considering for someone with her unsettling past.

She was born and grew up in a broken family in an average port, she lived free of worries until she was about 16 years old, but at that point things took a turn for the worst.

She killed somebody by accident during a rebellion and was caught up with the wrong people. Without any help she had to survive in a insane world. But with her fighting skills and charm, she managed to overpower anybody who's a hinderance and go beyond expectations. This has turned her into the woman she is today.
